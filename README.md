Although some features (such as code completion) can be used in vanilla Atom, it is recommended to install [atom-ide-ui](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui).

To use, open a Kotlin file inside a Gradle or Maven project. The language server will then automatically launch in the background.

## Features
