# Building
Describes how to build and run the extension.

## Development/Running
To build and link the Atom plugin into your local packages folder, run:

`apm link`

That's it! To use the extension, just reload your Atom window.

> Note that you might have to manually run `apm rebuild` and `apm link` in `editors/atom` if `apm` could not be found on your `PATH` or you are using Windows.
