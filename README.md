This package provides smart code completion, linting and more for Kotlin in Atom using the language server.

Although some features (such as code completion) can be used in vanilla Atom, it is recommended to install [atom-ide-ui](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui).

To use, open a Kotlin file inside a Gradle or Maven project. The language server will then automatically launch in the background.

## Features

* Code completion
* Linting
* Go-to-definition

## Development
